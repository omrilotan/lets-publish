## ðŸ›µ Publish only if this version was not already published

Check with NPM registry if this version was already published. If not, publish it.

```sh
npx @lets/publish@0
```

Passes on all arguments to `npm publish`

```sh
npx @lets/publish -- --tag next
```

> Depends on `npm` to check the registry and `jq` to check the local package.json
